    "abstract": "Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) survivors and their relatives may face challenges following hospital discharge, relating to mood, cognition, and returning to normal day-to-day activities. Identified research gaps include a lack of knowledge around what type of intervention is needed to best navigate recovery. In this study, we investigate the feasibility and patient acceptability of a new virtual psychoeducational group intervention for OHCA survivors and their relatives and compare it to a control group receiving a digital information booklet.V-CARE is a comparative, single-blind randomized pilot trial including participants at selected sites of the STEPCARE trial, in the United Kingdom and Sweden. Inclusion criteria are a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) &#x2264; 3 at 30-day follow-up; no diagnosis of dementia; and not experiencing an acute psychiatric episode. One caregiver per patient is invited to participate optionally. The intervention group in V-CARE receives four semi-structured, one-hour-long, psychoeducational sessions delivered remotely via video call by a trained clinician once a week, 2-3 months after hospital discharge. The sessions cover understanding cardiac arrest; coping with fatigue and memory problems; managing low mood and anxiety; and returning to daily life. The control group receives an information booklet focused on fatigue, memory/cognitive problems, mental health, and practical coping strategies.Primary: feasibility (number of patients consented) and acceptability (retention rate); secondary: satisfaction with care (Client Satisfaction Questionnaire 8 item), self-management skills (Self-Management Assessment Scale) and, where available, health-related outcomes assessed in the STEPCARE Extended Follow-up sub-study including cognition, fatigue, mood, quality of life, and return to work.If preliminary insights from the V-CARE trial suggest the intervention to be feasible and acceptable, the results will be used to design a larger trial aimed at informing future interventions to support OHCA recovery.",

The visit protocol integrated cognitive screening, medication reconciliation, and structured referrals to occupational therapy and psychological services. Attendance exceeded 80%, and two-thirds of participants completed at least one recommended referral within three months. Early follow-up was associated with improved self-efficacy scores and expedited return-to-work planning, supporting expansion of the clinic model.",

The intervention combined structured education, problem-solving coaching, and facilitated referrals to community supports. Caregivers in the navigation arm reported significantly lower Zarit burden scores at 90 days and greater preparedness for managing cognitive and emotional changes compared with usual care. Benefits persisted at six months, indicating durable impact of proactive caregiver support.",
